        The EU source I used for most countries switched from daily to weekly updates, which is not really compatible anymore with how I represented the data.<br/>
        I was considering to switch to the JHU-CCSE data, but it is quite some work to match the names of the regions with the names used on the geographical map data I found (places don't have standard names yet),
        and I don't have enough time currently to merge the two.

        I keep this here just as a reference, as only a few countries are still updating.<br/>
